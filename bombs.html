<p>Materials:</p>

<pre><code>          79 Cent Bic lighter
          Needle-nose pliers
          Tin snips or wire cutters
</code></pre>

<p>Procedure:</p>

<pre><code>First, rip the metal windguard off the lighter with  the  pliers and then
</code></pre>

<p>then twist  the  little  flame  adjuster  all  the way to the right, and keep
twisting until it won't move up anymore (stop  and twist  back  if  it starts
hissing).   There   is  a  gap  between  the  flame adjust  and  the  plastic
push-thing (it  moves  the  nozzle  up). You  then flatten the wind-guard out
and snip a notch in it big enough to fit around the nozzle.</p>

<pre><code>What  you  will  do is  you  will fit the metal piece in the slot between
</code></pre>

<p>the flame adjust and the plastic or the  ring  around  the nozzle, which ever
shows.  The metal  should be bent down, like the hose on a fire extinguisher.
make sure the 'handle' is snug.  You should glue carefully.</p>

<pre><code> You then hold the lighter backwards from how you would normally hold it,
</code></pre>

<p>thumb-tab  away.  You  will   strike   with  your  index  finger.   Practice.
Depress the handle with your thumb.  Strike, and have instant hell-fire!</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

                                FIREBOMBS

 Most fire bombs  are  simply  gasoline filled bottles with a fuel soaked
</code></pre>

<p>rag  in  the mouth (the  bottle's  mouth,  not  yours).  The original Molotov
cocktail,  and still about  the  best, was a mixture of one part gasoline and
one  part  motor oil.  The oil  helps  it  to  cling to what it splatters on.</p>

<pre><code> Some  use one  part roofing  tar and one part gasoline.  Fire bombs have
</code></pre>

<p>been found which were made by pouring melted wax into gasoline.</p>

<pre><code>                                 NAPALM

 About  the best  fire bomb  is napalm.  It has a thick consistency, like
</code></pre>

<p>jam and is best for use on vehicles or buildings.</p>

<pre><code> Napalm  is  simply one part  gasoline  and  one  part soap.  The soap is
</code></pre>

<p>either soap flakes or shredded bar soap.  Detergents won't do.</p>

<pre><code>                                                                   Page 2

 The gasoline  must be  heated in  order for the soap to melt.  The usual
</code></pre>

<p>way is  with  a  double boiler where  the  top  part has at least a two-quart
capacity.  The  water  in the bottom part is brought to a boil and the double
boiler is taken from the stove and carried to where there is no flame.</p>

<pre><code>  Then one part, by volume, of  gasoline  is  put  in  the  top  part and
</code></pre>

<p>allowed to heat as much as it will  and  the  soap  is  added and the mess is
stirred until  it  thickens.  A better way to heat gasoline is to fill a bath
tub with water as hot as you can get it.  It  will  hold  its heat longer and
permit a much larger container than will the double boiler.</p>

<pre><code>                             MATCH HEAD BOMB

 Simple  safety  match  heads in a  pipe,  capped  at  both  ends, make a
</code></pre>

<p>devastating bomb. It is set off with a regular fuse.</p>

<pre><code> A plastic  baggie is put into the pipe before the heads go in to prevent
</code></pre>

<p>detonation by contact with the metal.</p>

<pre><code> Cutting enough match heads  to fill the pipe can be tedious work for one
</code></pre>

<p>but an evening's fun for the family if you can drag them away from the TV.</p>

<pre><code>                         FUSE IGNITION FIRE BOMB

 A four strand home made fuse is used  for this.  It burns like fury.  It
</code></pre>

<p>is  held  down  and  concealed by a strip of bent  tin  cut from a  can.  The
exposed end of the  fuse is dipped into  the flare igniter.  To use this one,
you  light  the fuse and  hold the fire bomb until the fuse has burned out of
sight under the tin.  Then throw it and when it breaks, the burning fuse will
ignite the contents.</p>

 Napalm is in itself a very simple  substance... It  can be used for many
</code></pre>

<p>things  (i.e.  getting  back  at your neighbour!!).   Here's what  you  need:</p>

<p>Materials:</p>

<pre><code>          Gasoline
          Joy or Palmolive (I prefer Joy)
          Ammonia pellets
          Drill
          Coke can
          Bendable wire
          Nail
</code></pre>

<p>Procedure:</p>

<pre><code> First, make a mixture of 1/2 Joy,  and 1/2 gasoline.  Take the Coke can,
</code></pre>

<p>and  fill  it half  full  with  this wonderful  mixture.  It should look like
this:
                                                                       Page 3</p>

      ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

 Now,  take the  drill (or  some sharp object) and put a hole through the
</code></pre>

<p>ammonia  pellet big enough for the  nail.  Put the nail  through  the  pellet
(which I might  add  can be picked up at any farm supply store) and wire that
to the top of the can so the nail can  be  slipped  out  easily, allowing the
pellet  to  drop.  WARNING:  Do not let that pellet fall into the mixture, as
your wife will soon become a widow.</p>

                        By Zaphod Beeblebrox/MPG

 THIS ARTICLE  DEALS  WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING SOME  DANGEROUS
</code></pre>

<p>EXPLOSIVES.  IF YOU INTEND TO  MAKE ANY OF THESE EXPLOSIVES, DO  SO IN SMALL
AMOUNTS ONLY, AS THEY ARE ALL DANGEROUS  AND COULD SERIOUSLY  INJURE OR KILL
YOU IF DONE IN LARGER AMOUNTS. IF YOU  DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT  CHEMISTRY,
DON'T DO THESE EXPERIMENTS!  I AM NOT JOKING IN GIVING THIS WARNING.  UNLESS
YOU  HAVE  A  DEATH  WISH, YOU SHOULDN'T TRY ANY OF THE FOLLOWING UNLESS YOU
HAVE HAD PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH CHEMICALS.</p>

<p>I. COMMON "WEAK" EXPLOSIVES</p>

<p>A) Gunpowder:</p>

<pre><code>          75% Potassium Nitrate
          15% Charcoal
          10% Sulfur

 The chemicals should be ground into  a file  powder (separately!) with a
</code></pre>

<p>morter and  pestle. If gunpowder is ignited in the open, it  burns  fiercely,
but if in a closed  space  it  builds up pressure from the released gases and
can  explode   the  container.  Gunpowder  works  like  this:  The  potassium
nitrate  oxidizes the charcoal and sulfur, which then burns fiercely.  Carbon
dioxide and sulfur dioxide are the gases released.</p>

<p>B) Ammonal:</p>

<pre><code> Ammonal is  a mixture of  ammonium  nitrate  (a  strong  oxidizer)  with
</code></pre>

<p>aluminum powder (the 'fuel' in this case). I am not sure of the percentage of
composition for ammonial, so  you may want to experiment a little using small
amounts.</p>

<pre><code>                                                                   Page 4
</code></pre>

<p>C) Chemically Ignited Explosives:</p>

<p>Experiment 1:</p>

<pre><code> A mixture of 1  part  potassium  chlorate  to  3  parts  table  sugar
 (sucrose) burns fiercely  and brightly  (similar  to  the  burning of
 magnesium) when 1 drop  of  concentrated  sulfuric  acid is placed on
 it.  What occurs is this:  when  the  acid  is  added  it reacts with
 the potassium chlorate to form  chlorine  dioxide,  which explodes on
 formation, burning the sugar  as  well.
</code></pre>

<p>Experiment 2:</p>

<pre><code> Using various chemicals, I have  developed  a  mixture  that works very
 well  for  imitating volcanic eruptions.  I have given it the name 'MPG
 Volcanite'.  Here  it is:  Potassium chlorate + potassium perchlorate +
 ammonium nitrate + ammonium dichromate + potassium  nitrate  +  sugar +
 sulfur + iron filings + charcoal +  zinc  dust  +  some coloring agent.
 (Scarlet  =  strontium  nitrate,  Purple  =  Iodine  crystals, Yellow =
 Sodium chloride, Crimson = Calcium chloride, etc).
</code></pre>

<p>Experiment 3:</p>

<pre><code> So,  do  you  think  water  puts out fires?  In this one, it starts it!
 Mixture:  Ammonium  nitrate  +  ammonium chloride + iodine + zinc dust.
 When a drop or two of water is added, the ammonium nitrate forms nitric
 acid which reacts with the zinc to produce hydrogen and heat.  The heat
 vaporizes the  iodine  (giving  off  purple  smoke)  and  the  ammonium
 chloride (becomes  purple  when  mixed with iodine vapor).  It also may
 ignite the hydrogen and begin burning.

   Ammonium nitrate:  8g
  Ammonium chloride:  1g
          Zinc dust:  8g
    Iodine crystals:  1g
</code></pre>

<p>Experiment 4:</p>

<pre><code> Potassium permanganate + glycerine when mixed produces a purple-coloured
 flame  in  30  seconds  to  1  minute.  Works  best  if  the   potassium
 permanganate is finely ground.
</code></pre>

<p>Experiment 5:</p>

<pre><code> Calcium  carbide  + water releases acetylene gas (highly  flammable  gas
 used in blow torches).
</code></pre>

<p>II. THERMITE REACTION</p>

<pre><code> The thermite reaction  is  used  in welding, because it generates molten
</code></pre>

<p>iron  and temperatures of  3500 C  (6000F+).  It  uses  one  of  the previous
reactions that I talked about to start it!</p>

<pre><code>Starter = Potassium chlorate + Sugar
</code></pre>

<p>Main Part = Iron (III) oxide + Aluminum powder (325 mesh or finer)
                                                                       Page 5</p>

<pre><code> Put  the potassium chlorate +  sugar around and on top of the main part.
</code></pre>

<p>To  start  the reaction place  one  drop of concentrated sulfuric acid on top
of the starter mixture.  Step back!  The ratios are: 3 parts iron (III) oxide
to 1 part aluminum powder to 1 part potassium chlorate to 1 part sugar.  When
you first do it, try 3G:1G:1G:1G! Also, there is  an  alternative starter for
the thermite reaction. The alternative is potassium Permanganate + Glycerine.
Amount: 55g Iron(III) oxide, 15g aluminum powder, 25g potassium permanganate,
6ml glycerine.</p>

<p>III. NITROGEN-CONTAINING HIGH EXPLOSIVES</p>

<p>A) Mercury (II) Fulminate</p>

<pre><code> To  produce  mercury  (II) Fulminate, a very sensitive shock explosive,
</code></pre>

<p>one might assume that  it  could  be  formed  by  adding  fulminic  acid  to
mercury.  This  is  somewhat  difficult since fulminic acid is very unstable
and cannot be purchased.  I  did some research and figured out a way to make
it without fulminic acid.  You add 2 parts nitric acid to 2 parts alcohol to
1 part mercury.  This is  theoretical  (I  have not yet tried it) so please,
if you try this, do it in  VERY  small  amounts  and  tell  me  the results.</p>

<p>B) Nitrogen Triiodide</p>

<pre><code> Nitrogen  Triiodide  is  a  very  powerful  and  very  shock  sensitive
</code></pre>

<p>explosive.  Never  store it and be careful when you're around it; sound, air
movements, and other tiny things could set it off.</p>

<p>Materials:</p>

<pre><code>          2-3g Iodine
          15ml Concentrated ammonia
          8 Sheets of filter paper
          50ml beaker
          Feather mounted on a two meter pole
          Ear Plugs
          Tape
          Spatula
          Stirring Rod
</code></pre>

<p>Procedure:</p>

<pre><code> Add 2-3g iodine to 15ml ammonia in the 50ml beaker.  Stir, let stand for
</code></pre>

<p>5 minutes.  Do the  following  within  5  minutes:  Retain  the solid, decant
the liquid (pour off the liquid but keep the brown solid).  Scrape  the brown
residue of nitrogen triiodide onto a stack of four sheets  of  filter  paper.
Divide  solid into four parts, putting each on a separate sheet of dry filter
paper.  Tape  in  position, leave  to dry undisturbed for at least 30 minutes
(preferably longer).  To detonate,  touch  with  feather (wear ear plugs when
detonating or cover ears; it is very loud!).</p>

<p>C) Cellulose Nitrate (Guncotton)</p>

<pre><code> Commonly known  as  smokeless powder, nitrocellulose is exactly that; it
</code></pre>

<p>does not give off smoke when it burns.</p>

<pre><code>                                                                   Page 6
</code></pre>

<p>Materials:</p>

<pre><code>          70ml  Concentrated sulfuric acid
          30ml  Concentrated nitric acid
          5g    Absorbent cotton
          250ml 1M Sodium bicarbonate
          250ml beaker
          Ice bath
          Tongs
          Paper towels
</code></pre>

<p>Procedure:</p>

<pre><code> Place 250ml beaker  in  the  ice  bath,  add  70ml  sulfuric  acid, 30ml
</code></pre>

<p>nitric acid.  Divide cotton into 0.7g pieces.  With tongs, immerse each piece
in  the  acid  solution for 1 minute.  Next, rinse each piece in 3 successive
baths  of  500ml  water.  Use  fresh water for each piece.  Then  immerse  in
250ml 1M Sodium Bicarbonate.  If it bubbles, rinse in water once  more  until
no bubbling occurs.  Squeeze dry and spread on paper towels, compress it into
cakes  or  blocks  or  gelatanize  it  with acetone.  This is powerful stuff!</p>

<p>D) Acetone Hydrogen Explosive:</p>

<p>Materials:</p>

<pre><code>       4ml Acetone
       4ml 30% hydrogen peroxide
       4 Drops concentrated hydrochloric acid
       150mm test tube

 Add 4ml acetone and  4ml  hydrogen  peroxide  to  the test tube.  Then
</code></pre>

<p>add 4 drops concentrated hydrochloric acid.  In 10-20 minutes a white solid
should begin to appear.  If no change is observed, warm the  test tube in a
water bath at 40 Celsius.  Allow the reaction to continue  for  two  hours.
Swirl the slurry and filter it.  Leave out on filter paper to  dry  for  at
least two hours.  To ignite, light a candle tied to a meter stick and light
it (while standing at least a meter away).</p>

<p>E) Smoke, Smoke, Smoke...</p>

<pre><code> The following reaction should produce a fair amount  of  smoke.  Since
</code></pre>

<p>this  reaction  is  not  all  the  dangerous, you can use larger amounts if
necessary for larger amounts of smoke.</p>

<p>6g Zinc powder
   1g Sulfur Powder</p>

<pre><code> Insert a red hot wire into the pile, step back.  A lot of smoke should
</code></pre>

<p>be created.</p>

<pre><code>                                                                   Page 7

</code></pre>

<p>Method A:</p>

<p>Materials:</p>

<pre><code>          Gasoline  - 1 part
          Oil       - 1 half part
          Styrofoam - 1 part
</code></pre>

<p>1) Melt styrofoam (remember NEVER at  ANY  time let the mixture get too hot)!
   NOTE:  Do NOT inhale the fumes - they are deady!</p>

<p>2) Let cool to a thick viscosity.</p>

<p>3) Mix 3 ingredients together in the following order: Styrofoam, oil, &amp;  gas.</p>

<p>4) Mix in a deep pot - Keep mixture away  from  any  type  of  fire!  Do this
   step with extreme caution!</p>

<p>5) Let  the mixture  cool to a little bit warmer that room temperature, which
   is around 88 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>6) Mold  the mixture  how  you  want  (different  shapes will make it more or
   less lethal).</p>

<p>Dr. Booms Method:</p>

<p>Materials:</p>

<pre><code>          20ml gasoline
          5-10 plastic bags
          10ml oil or starter fluid
          50ml beaker or glass bowl
          gunpowder, guncotton or acetone hydrogen
</code></pre>

<p>Procedure:</p>

<pre><code>Pour gas in glass container and add bags to gas and dissolve until fairly
</code></pre>

<p>thick vicosity like melted marshmallow (actually, marshmallows would probably
work just as well or better than plastic bags!)  and add oil.  Add bags again
until very thick.  Add  the  guncotton  and  mix well.  Keep on adding strips
of   plastic   until  no  more  will  dissolve  and  then  pour  in  a  mold.
NOTE:  It would a good  idea  to  heat  this  stuff  with  a  double  boiler.</p>

<p>Optional: You can  add  nuts,  bolts,  and  screws  while  mixing, along with
gunpowder,  2 M-80's  or   any  other  type  of  explosive  to  make  it  the
equivalent  of  a  Molotov   cocktail,  but  be warned:  The fragments (nuts,
bolts, etc.) are deadly.  They  will penetrate  a brick wall when the mixture
is detonated.</p>

<pre><code>                                                                   Page 8
</code></pre>

<p>Detonation:</p>

<p>1) The mixture  can  be  thrown,  but  sometimes  detonation does not occur.</p>

<p>2) The  mixture  can  be  wired  for  an  electric charge to be sent through
   it.  It will detonate without doubt.  A  regular fuse can be sent through
   it  also.  If this  method is used, some sort  of timer  is  recommended.</p>

 Thermite  is  a  powerful  substance which can burn through practically
</code></pre>

<p>anything, save tungsten.  It  is  especially  of use in trying to crack open
a  fortress  fone.  How  here's  how  you  make  it.  It  is  very   simple.</p>

<pre><code> The  first  step  in making thermite is to make hematite.  In laymans's

<p>terms,  Hemetite  is  iron  oxide  (rust).  Here  is a good method of making
large quantities of rust.  You  will  electrolyze  a  metal  rod,  such as a
common nail.  You will need a source of  DC  power  as  well.   An  electric
train transformer is perfect.  Attach  the  rod  to the positive wire.  Then
place the rod and the negative wire in opposite  sides of a glass jar filled
with water.  Put a little salt in the water, just  enough to make it conduct
well (a teaspoon).  Let the setup sit overnight.  In the morning, there will
be a dark red crud in the jar.  Filter all the crud out of the water of just
fish it out will a spoon.  Now you will need to  dry  it out.  Heat it in an
iron pot until it all turns a nice light red.</p>

<pre><code> The  other  ingredient  you  will  need  is  aluminum filings.  You can
</code></pre>

<p>either file down a  bar  of  aluminum,  or  (as  I  suggest),  but  aluminum
filings at your  local  hardware  shop  (if  you  buy  the  bar, use no less
than 94% pure aluminum - it is called duralumin).</p>

<pre><code> That's  almost  it!   Now,  mix together the rust and aluminum filings.
</code></pre>

<p>The ratio should be 8 grams of rust per 3 grams of aluminum filings.  That's
thermite!</p>

<pre><code> Now, to light it!  Stick a length  of  magnesium  ribbon  in  a pile of
</code></pre>

<p>the  thermite  (either  steal  it  from  a  chem lab or buy it at your local
hardware store).  If not, order from a  chemical  supply house.  It's pretty
cheap).  The  ribbon  should  stick  into  the   thermite   like   a   fuse.</p>

<pre><code> Now you light the magnesium with  a  blowtorch  (don't worry, the torch
</code></pre>

<p>isn't  hot  enough  to  light the thermite).   When  the  burning  magnesium
reaches the thermite,  it  will  light.  When  the  thermite  burns, get the
hell back!   That  stuff  can  vaporize carbon steel, and it does wonders on
human flesh!</p>

<p>illegal use.   The writer cannot be held  responsible  for anything  you
do  to yourself!!!!   If there are any  spelling or grammatical  errors,
then FUCK OFF AND DIE cause I don't really care...  my  point  is driven
across.</p>

<pre><code> Well  first  of all in order to make a pipe bomb , you  must  first
</code></pre>

<p>have a pipe.  It doesn't matter how big, or how small,  you  could use a
1 inch copper pipe, or you could use a 2 foot long drainage  pipe.  Once
you  have  this,  you  will  need  a   few   ingredients  first.   These
ingredients make a substance called  'flash  powder'.  This can be a lot
of  fun if you make a pile of it about  1/4  lbs.  and have your  friend
light  it  with  a match (some friend).  Well,  here's  what  you  need:</p>

<p>1> Potassium Chlorate (get it at any chemical store)
  2> Powdered Charcoal (not briquets, take some ash from the fire place)
  3> Powdered Magnesium (ground up mag. fire starters from camping sections)
  4> Sulfur (you know where to get this!)
  5> Some kind of piping
  6> Hot glue gun, or melted glue
  7> Small drill bit and drill
  8> Tissue paper (ie. Kleenex)
  9> Mist water bottle + sprayer (Windex bottle, etc..)</p>

<pre><code> The  magnesium  has  to be FINE!!! The finer the faster! You can get
</code></pre>

<p>them  in the camping sections  of  Caldor,  and  Sears.  They look like a
block of aluminum on a key chain ($5.00 - $7.00  butthey go a long way!).</p>

<pre><code> Now that you have the stuff,  start the  work.   Find  a  drill  bit
</code></pre>

<p>about  the  size of a pencil point,  and drill  a  small hole about  dead
center of the pipe, only drill thru one side of  the  pipe,  don't  drill
both  sides.   Now you should have a  piece  of  pipe,  with a small hole
drilled  into  it.   After this,  take  some  hot  glue (hot glue  gun or
such).   Take a piece of regular paper (not tissue)  and  stuff  it  into
one  end of the pipe,  so it plugs up the hole, and  is  about  2cm  into
the pipe.   Now fill that end with melted glue  over  the  paper,  so its
about even with the pipe, and sit that  down  on  another piece of paper.
Now you should have a pipe with a small hole  in  the center, and one end
with about 2 cm of glue on it, and 2 pieces  of  paper on either side  of
the glue.</p>

<pre><code> So  far  so  good...  now  for  the  flash   powder.   Pour  in  the
</code></pre>

<p>potassium chlorate  (largest amount).   Then  pour  in  the  charcoal  (a
little less than the chlorate). Pour this stuff  into  a  grinding plate,
not the pipe. Now for the magnesium you filed off the  block  and  ground
up finally,  make this a bit  less  than  the  charcoal  amount.   Lastly
add  the  sulphur,  only a little though,  about  half  as  much  as  the
magnesium  you  just put in.   Now grind  all  the  ingredients  together
until they look like  1  grey  dust.   Try a little bit (no not the whole
damn thing! save that for the  fun later!).  Light it and see how fast it
goes  off.   Your  gonna  have  to fiddle with it until it turns out  the
                                                                      Page 10</p>

<p>fastest (sounds like something else eh?).</p>

<pre><code> Now that you have the flash powder ready,  stick a piece of  tape
</code></pre>

<p>over the small hole you drilled (so nothing spills out).  Put the pipe
over  a sheet of regular paper so you don't loose any of this precious
flash powder and start to poor it into the pipe.   One the pipe  seems
full,  place  a piece of paper over the opening in that end,  and pack
that piece of paper, and the powder down into the pipe.</p>

<pre><code> Take  the paper out,  and pour more powder in.   Keep  doing  his
</code></pre>

<p>until  its very well packed,  and its almost full!  Make sure that the
flash powder fills above the small hole you drilled!  Now put a  piece
of  paper over the powder, and give it one last pack (a small rod, and
a hammer will do just fine, but make sure you don't get any sparks!!).</p>

<pre><code> After  that,  pour in your final glue in the end you just packed,
</code></pre>

<p>make sure it fills to about 2 cm of glue in that end, over the  paper!
Stick  another  piece of paper over that end (just glued) and  let  it
dry, but when drying put it on a flat surface so it hardens flat!</p>

<pre><code> While your waiting for it to dry, take your tissue paper, and lie
</code></pre>

<p>it  down flat on the table,  over a piece of cardboard or something if
its  a good table!!  Now mix some water with the flash  powder  (about
1/2-1/2  mix).   No  it  won't  kill the powder.   Now  shake  up  the
bottle, and  spray the tissue paper with the mixture Let  it  dry, and
repeat  the sequence.   After about 4 shots on 1 side,  repeat on  the
other  side (flip the tissue paper).  Continue this until your liking.
When this is done,  and the tissue paper is dry,  tear/cut off a small
sheet, roll it, and light it.</p>

<pre><code> If you like it, then fine, if not, then keep spraying it.  If you
</code></pre>

<p>like  to,  before rolling  it,  pour in some  flash  powder  (not  too
much!!!)  and roll it like a joint.   Then twist it.   You now have  a
fuse (really?!?!).  Make sure its long!!</p>

<pre><code> Now for the final assembly.  Take the tape off the small hole you
</code></pre>

<p>drilled,  and  poke  thru the powder with a pencil point/ice  pick  or
whatever (or the drill bit!).   If you REALLY want to, then put a drop
of glue to hold the fuse in better,  but you don't have to!!  (not too
much!).   Now  make sure the glue has hardened for about 1 hour or  so
until its rock hard (no ideas!).</p>

<pre><code> You are now the proud owner of a home made PIPE BOMB.   Great for
</code></pre>

<p>parties/special occasions, weddings, Russians, mail boxes and anything
else  you want to do.  When you light this bomb,  point the end in the
direction you are gonna be running in, and don't throw it (unless your
crazy,  and in that case,  I don't give a shit!) so it doesn't frag in
your face!!</p>

<pre><code>If  you  really want to fancy it up, you can always  use  threaded
</code></pre>

<p>steel end caps!!!!!!</p>

<pre><code> Well I hope you enjoyed your fun today, and happy bomb making!

<p>This one is short and sweet:</p>

<p>1) Get hold of a glass jug, put in a few drops of gasoline and cap the top.</p>

<p>3) Now turn the jug around to  coat  the  inner  surfaces  and  evaporates.</p>

<p>4) Add a few drops of potassium  permanganate  (you  can get this real easy
   from a snake-bite kit).</p>

 Probably the most important explosive compound in use today is TNT
</code></pre>

<p>(trinitrotoluene).   This  and  other very  similar types of  high  ex-
plosives  are  all used by the military,  because  of  their  fantastic
power,  about  2.25 millions pounds per square  inch,  and their  great
stability.   TNT  also  has  the great advantage  of being able  to  be
melted  at  82  degrees F.,  so that  it can  be  poured  into  shells,
mortars,  or any other projectiles.   Military  TNT comes in containers
which  resemble  dry cell batteries,  and  are  usually ignited  by  an
electrical charge,  coupled with an electrical blasting  cap,  although
there are other methods.</p>

<p>Preparation of TNT:</p>

<p>1 -   Take two beakers.  In the first prepare a solution of 76 percent
      sulfuric acid,  23 percent nitric acid and 1 percent water.   In
      the other beaker, prepare another  solution of 57 percent nitric
      acid  and 43 percent sulfuric acid (percentages are on a  weight
      ratio rather than volume).</p>

<p>2 -   Ten grams of the first solutions are poured into an empty beaker
      and placed in an ice bath.</p>

<p>3 -   Add  ten  grams  of  toluene,  and  stir  for  several  minutes.</p>

<p>4 -   Remove  this  beaker from the ice bath and gently heat until  it
      reaches 50 degrees C.   The solution is stirred constantly while
      being heated.</p>

<p>5 -   Fifty additional grams of the acid,  from the first beaker,  are
      added and the temperature is held for the next ten minutes,  and
      an  oily  liquid  will  begin  to  form  on the top of the acid.
                                                                      Page 12</p>

<p>6 -   After 10 or 12 minutes, the acid solution is returned to the ice
      bath,   and  cooled  to  45  degrees  C.   When  reaching   this
      temperature, the oily liquid will sink and collect at the bottom
      of  the  beaker.   At this point,  the remaining  acid  solution
      should be drawn off, by using a syringe.</p>

<p>7 -   Fifty  more  grams of the first acid solution are added  to  the
      oily  liquid while the temperature is SLOWLY being raised to  83
      degrees C.  After this temperature is reached,  it is maintained
      for a full half hour.</p>

<p>8 -   At the end of this period, the solution is allowed to cool to 60
      degrees  C,  and  is held at  this temperature for another  full
      half hour. After this, the acid is again drawn off, leaving once
      more only the oily liquid at the bottom.</p>

<p>9 -   Thirty grams of sulfuric acid are added,  while the oily  liquid
      is  gently  heated to 80 degrees C.   All temperature  increases
      must be accomplished slowly and gently.</p>

<p>10 -  Once the desired temperature is reached,  30 grams of the second
      acid solution are added,  and the temperature is raised from  80
      degrees C to 104 degrees C, and is held for three hours.</p>

<p>11 -  After  this  three hour period,  the mixture is lowered  to  100
      degrees C and held there for a half hour.</p>

<p>12 -  After  this  half  hour,  the oil is removed form the  acid  and
      washed with boiling water.</p>

<p>13 -  After  the  washing  with  boiling  water, while  being  stirred
      constantly, the TNT will begin to solidify.</p>

<p>14 -  When the solidification has started,  cold water is added to the
      beaker,  so that the TNT will form into pellets.   Once this  is
      done, you have a good quality TNT.</p>

<p>NOTE: The  temperatures used in the preparation of TNT are EXACT,  and
      must  be used as such.   DO NOT estimate or  use approximations.
      Buy a good centigrade thermometer.</p>

<p>WARNING:  This stuff is very dangerous, wear goggles at ALL times and
          for God's sake don't SNEEZE while making it!</p>

<p>Materials:</p>

<pre><code>          Glass bowl and glass rod
          Water (lots of it)
          Sulfuric acid
          Nitric Acid
          Glycerin
          Refrigerator

Make sure you get a GLASS bowl and stirring rod.  The Sulfuric acid
</code></pre>

<p>and Nitric acid are about 5 bucks each at a chemical warehouse and  you
can get the glycerin from a clear, yellow/brown  bar  of  soap  from  a
health food store (i.e. - Cardish).</p>

<p>Procedure:</p>

<pre><code>Carefully mix equal  amounts  of  the  acids in a glass bowl of 2 parts
</code></pre>

<p>water to 3 parts of the mixture of  acid.  Put mixture and bar of glycerine
soap in the fridge by the milk (don't freeze  the damn thing!) and leave it
for 2 hours. Since the mixture won't blow up until 15 C, the fridge's temp-
erature (5 C) will  prevent  detonation  (and we don't want THAT to happen,
or at least not NOW).  Shred the soap to a flaky powder and  dissolve it in
the  acid  solution (and KEEP it in the fridge ALWAYS, or ELSE!).  Leave it
in the fridge for 5 days (since this process takes a long time), and after
5 days you should have an oily yellow substance (which is  quite  lethal),
and some liquid acid left.  Skim off the  excess  acid  to  leave only the
thick yellow gunk (nitro) and add lots of water to  it  (don't drown it or
you're fucked) and put it back in the fridge  until  you  need  it - never
keep it out of the fridge too long (and  make  sure  it's  not  eaten  for
dinner).  It  can  be detonated by  dropping  it, throwing it, shaking it,
by sneezing on it, or with an electrical charge (such as a timer).</p>

<pre><code>You might want to soak  it in sawdust or something similar so it won't
</code></pre>

<p>blow up as easily if you  happen  to accidentally bump it or something.</p>

<p>DANGER:  Dynamite is highly explosive (although great fun), and we suggest
         that if you actually  attempt  to make this - make it in very low
         quantities so you don't blow the roof off your  house.  Also  use
         extreme caution if you live in an earthquake zone!</p>

<p>Materials:</p>

<pre><code>          thermometer
          glass bowls
          stirring rods
          nitroglycerin
          newspaper or Kieselguhr
          sodium, potassium, or ammonium nitrate
          guncotton, gunpowder or plastic explosives
          cotton and cardboard
          detonator (see below)

Newspaper is used here, but originally you use Kieselguhr (a  porous
</code></pre>

<p>silica substance) but the book says  that  newspaper works just as well.
With the silica substance it is more like plastic, with wood pulp it  is
more like paper mache.</p>

<p>Procedure:</p>

<pre><code>First soak strips of  newspaper overnight so they become mushy and then
</code></pre>

<p>mush it in your hands (isn't  this  fun?!?)  until  it  becomes more like a
paste (you can do that with the blender set on liquify to speed things up).
Keep the nitroglycerine in the fridge at all times!</p>

<pre><code>Collect the pulpwith a strainer and let it dry slightly and then add on
</code></pre>

<p>add on the chemicals listed above (except for the nitroglycerine) with pulp
being 2 parts and the chemicals being 1 part (ratio 2:1).  Mix well.</p>

<pre><code>Almost done!  Now put it in the fridge for an hour and then pour 1 part
</code></pre>

<p>nitroglycerine and  1.5 parts mixture (ratio 1:1.5) and use the thermometer
to make sure everything is below 15 C.</p>

<pre><code>Now make a cardboard  tube  3  inches  long  with a radius of 1cm.  Put
</code></pre>

<p>cotton  in  one end as a plug and pour in the  dynamite  until  it  is  2/3
full  (2"  down  the  tube) and leave it in a safe (DRY) place where it can
dry peacefully and pray that there isn't an earthquake!</p>

<pre><code>When it's  dry,  fill the remaining 1 inch (1/3) with either gunpowder,
</code></pre>

<p>guncotton or plastic explosives  and cap the top and stick in a fuse, which
should be wires with a rocket igniter at the end connected to a copper wire
a   L O N G   distance away to a  power  source.  You can also use a timer,
but DON'T LIGHT the damn thing!</p>

<pre><code>Be careful with this stuff  unless  you  want  to  join  AstroBoy - the
</code></pre>

<p>pressure given off is about 2 million pounds per square inch.

<pre><code>                       DETONATING TNT AND DYNAMITE

                               by Dr. Boom

Even though  TNT and Dynamite are powerful  explosives,  to  set  them
</code></pre>

<p>off you need a smaller explosion or a charge.  For the shock needed to set
them off, plastic  explosives  can  be  used.  It's easy to make and quite
powerful.  Let's say you use TNT:  There's  the  two  basic ways to do it.
If you want to use a ping pong ball, fill it  half  way  with TNT and fill
the other half with plastic explosives.  Since your using small amounts of
TNT,  you  can  use  a  LONG fuse (at least 1 foot)  of  magnesium  ribbon
as a fuse, but never put it under a  car  or  it'll  blow it up (yes, it's
still pretty damn powerful).</p>

<pre><code>If you're a little  nuts  and  decide  to make a large charge, I would
</code></pre>

<p>recomment  using  an  electronic  detonator  or  timer.   Well, I hope you
enjoy your bomb making (if you ever go to the  CN  tower,  bring  a little
ball  of  Dynamite or TNT and rop it  and  30  seconds  later,  enjoy  the
fireworks -the shock is strong enough to detonate it.  A penny will
penetrate 1 food into concrete!).</p>

Drill a hole in a ping pong  ball  and  fill  it  up  with  plastic

<p>explosives. If you're lucky enough to live in a high rise apartment, do
this:  Take your ping pong ball bomb  and  put  a magnesium ribbon fuse
(1 foot long)  in  the  ball (you can add BB pellets) and  light  it at
midnight and throw it down!</p>

<p>The foot long fuse should should give it 30  seconds  to  Dr. Boom Doom

<p>II.  WIMPY, BUT PRETTY SAFE EXPERIMENTS <phew></p>

<p>Experiment 1:  Generating Chlorine Gas</p>

<pre><code>Ever wonder why ammonia bottles always say "Do not  mix  with  chlorine
</code></pre>

<p>bleach" and vice versa?  That's because if you mix ammonia water with Ajax
 or something like it, it will give off chlorine gas.  To capture it, get a
 large bottle and put Ajax in the bottom.  Then pour some ammonia down into
 the bottle.  Since the chlorine is heavier than  air, it will stay down in
 there unless you use large amounts of either Ajax or Ammonia (DON'T).  For
 something fun do with chlorine, stay tuned.</p>

<p>Experiment 2:  Chlorine and Turpentine</p>

<pre><code>Take a small cloth or rag  and  soak  it  in  turpentine.  Quickly drop
</code></pre>

<p>it into the bottle of chlorine.  It  should  give  off alot of black smoke
 and probably start burning.</p>

<p>Experiment 3:  Generating Hydrogen Gas</p>

<pre><code>To generate hydrogen, all you need is an acid  and  a  metal  that  will
</code></pre>

<p>react with that acid.  Try  vinegar  (acetic  acid)  with  zinc,  aluminum,
 magnesium, etc.  You can collect hydrogen in  something if you note that it
 is lighter than air.  Light a small  amount  and it burns with a small POP.</p>

<pre><code>Another way of creating  hydrogen is by the electrolysis of water.  This
</code></pre>

<p>involves separating water (H2O)  into hydrogen  and  oxygen  by an electric
 current.  To do this, you need a 6-12 volt battery, two test tubes, a large
 bowl, two carbon electrodes (take  them  out  of  an  unworking  6-12  volt
 battery), and table salt.  Dissolve the salt in a large bowl full of water.
 Submerge the two test tubes in the water and put the electrodes inside them
 with the mouth of the tube aiming down.  Connect  the  battery to some wire
 going down to the electrodes.  This will work for  a  while,  but  chlorine
 will be generated along with the oxygen which will undoubtedly corrode your
 copper wires leading to the carbon electrodes (the  table salt is broken up
 into chlorine and sodium ions, the chlorine comes off  as a gas with oxygen
                                                                      Page 17</p>

<p>while sodium reacts with the water to form sodium hydroxide). Therefore, if
 you can get your hands on some sulfuric acid, use it instead.  It  will not
 affect the reaction other than making the water conduct electricity.</p>

<p>Experiment 4:  Hydrogen and Chlorine</p>

<pre><code>Take the test tube of hydrogen and cover  the  mouth  with  your  thumb.
</code></pre>

<p>Keep it inverted, and bring it near the bottle of chlorine  (not  one  that
 has reacted with turpentine).  Say "goodbye test tube,"  and  drop  it into
 the bottle.  The hydrogen and chlorine should react  and  possible  explode
 (depending on purity and amount of each gas).  An  interesting  thing about
 this is they will not react if it is dark and no heat  or  other energy  is
 around.  When a light is turned on, enough energy is produced to cause them
 to react.</p>

<p>Experiment 5:  Iodine</p>

<pre><code>Tincture of iodine  contains mainly alcogol and a little iodine.  To
</code></pre>

<p>separate them, put the ticture of iodine in a metal lid to a bottle and
 heat it over a candle.  Have a stand holding another metal lid directly
 over the candle.  Have a stand holding  another metal lid directly over
 the tincture (about 4-6 inches above it) with ice  on  top  of it.  The
 alcohol should evaporate, and the  iodine  should  sublime, but  should
 reform iodine crystals on the cold metal lid  directly  above.  You can
 use the iodine along with household ammonia to form nitrogen  triiodide
 (discussion further up in this document).</p>

<p>Experiment 6:  Grain-Elevator Explosion</p>

<pre><code>Want  to  try  your own "grain-elevator explosion?"  Get  a  candle  and
</code></pre>

<p>some flour.  Light the candle and put some flour in your hand.  Try various
 ways of getting the  flour  to  leave  your hand and become dust right over
 the  candle  flame.  The  enormous  surface  area  allows all the tiny dust
 particles  to burn, which they do at about the same time, combining to form
 a fireball effect.  In  grain  elevators, much  the same thing happens.  If
 you can get your hands on some Lycopodium powder, do.  This  will work much
 better, creating huge fireballs that are unexpected.</p>

  This  explosive  can not only  be  used  as an explosive, but also as a
</code></pre>

<p>detonator.  I  will  go  into  this  one  very  detailed and all my following
articles will be the same.</p>

<p>Materials:</p>

<p>Hydrogen Peroxide (hair bleach, drug stores and hair supply stores)
Acetone (hardware Stores and drug stores)
Sulfuric Acid (clear battery acid boiled until white fumes appear)
Eye Dropper or Syringe w/glass tube
Graduated Cylinder (cc or ml)
Thermometer (0 to 100 degrees C)
Glass Containers
Large Pan
Ice and Salt
Water
Paper Towels</p>

<p>All the above can easily be commandeered from your school laboratory for your
own purposes.</p>

<p>Procedure:</p>

<p>1)  Mix 30 ml of Acetone and 50ml of Hydrogen Peroxide into a glass container
    and mix thoroughly.</p>

<p>2)  Cool it by placing it in a  larger container  containing  ice, salt,  and
    water.  Now cool it to 5 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>3)  Add 2.5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid to the mixture  slowly  (drop by
    drop w/ the eye dropper).  Stir the mixture w/the thermometer keeping the
    temperature  between  5-10  degrees  Celsius.  If  the temperature  rises
    don't shit just stop adding the  sulfuric acid until it cools  down  then
    start adding it again.</p>

<p>4)  Now  that you have all  the  acid  into the mixture continue stirring for
    another 5 minutes.</p>

<p>5)  Now let the mixture stand for 12 to 24 hours in the ice/salt bath.</p>

<p>6)  After 12 hours the crystals of acetone peroxide will precipitate  out  of
    the once  clear  solution.  Precipitation should be done after 24  hours.</p>

<p>7)  Now filter out the  crystals  through a paper towel attached to a jar w/a
    rubber band.  Then after that wash the crystals by pouring ice cold water
    over them, letting the water rinse the crystals &amp; filter down through the
    paper towel into the jar.</p>

<p>8)  Select a container and allow them to dry.</p>

<pre><code>                                                                  Page 19
</code></pre>

<p>Uses:</p>

<pre><code>Now this can be used as an explosive however it is the simplest  detonator
</code></pre>

<p>that I have ever encountered.  Works best in 2.5 inch  lengths of brass tubing
with one end sealed.  The only drawback is that it must  be  used  quickly  as
Acetone   Peroxide   deteriorates   quickly.   I  have  found that keeping  it
refrigerated seems to make it last longer however for optimum effect it should
be used 7 days after  manufacture  at the latest.  It  also  can  be  used  to
detonate  almost  every  Ammonium  Nitrate   compound,  and  Ammonium  Nitrate
itself for that matter.</p>

  This one  is  a  killer  it  is more powerful and more brisant than C-4.
</code></pre>

<p>However you need a blasting cap to detonate or a  homemade compound detonator.
Namely  Acetone   Peroxide  detonators  can  be  used  here  or  Mini-Compound
Detonators.</p>

<p>Materials:</p>

<p>Ammonium Nitrate Fertilizer (no less than            -  Farm and Feed Stores
32% Nitrogen) or pure</p>

<p>Anhydrous Hydrazine                                  -  Chemical Supply House
(Be careful with this one it is very reactive!!!)</p>

<p>Large Mixing Container
GLASS stirring rod
Storage Container w/tight lid
Blasting Cap or Compound Detonator</p>

<p>Procedure:</p>

<p>NOTE: mixing  these two is the same as baking soda and vinegar so the reaction
is very effervescent &amp; can bubble over the top so use a jar 6 times the volume
of  the Hydrazine!  Also large volumes  of ammonia gas are released when these
two are mixed so wear a gas mask or be upwind of the mixing.</p>

<p>1)  Pour into the container the an amount of Anhyrdrous Hydrazine equal to the
    amount of explosive required.</p>

<p>2)  Ammonium Nitrate Prilled or Powdered is added a teaspoon  at a time to the
    container, then wait for it to dissolve (stirring constantly),  &amp; then add
    more.</p>

<p>3)  Continue the above process until the ammonium nitrate  no longer dissolves
    into the hydrazine, and don't worry  about  the small amount  of  ammonium
    nitrate left over.</p>

<p>4)  Now your basically done and  you  have an explosive more powerful than any
    military explosive.
                                                                      Page 20</p>

<p>5)  To make it  more powerful add 20% aluminum powder to the mixture (100 mesh
    or finer)</p>

<p>Uses:</p>

<pre><code>This mixture has unique absorption and retention  properties,  and  can be
</code></pre>

<p>poured directly on the ground for a liquid land mine.  This  type of land mine
is totally disguised and cannot be noticed, and  all  you need to do is bury a
compound detonator in the ground, which can be detonated by a step switch etc.</p>

<pre><code>This type of land mine remains  detonatable for up to four days regardless
</code></pre>

<p>of rain etc...  It can also be poured  into  a  container  and used as a bomb.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The reason I wrote this is because the other file I saw on how to make RDX
was so shabby and lame it was probably  written  by  an eight year old mental
patient.  So here is mine easy!  Straightforward!  Comprehendible!</p>

<p>Materials:</p>

<p>Hexamethylenetetramine (drug stores under Hexamin, Urotropine, &amp; Methenamine)
Strong Nitric Acid (chemical supply house or some hardware stores)
Acetone (drug stores and hardware stores)
Scale with gram accuracy
Graduated Cylinder (cc or ml) or measuring cups
Thermometer 20-100 degrees Celsius or 68-212 degrees Fahrenheit
Several large quart canning jars
Two large basins or bowls made of metal or some other heatable metal
Paper Towels</p>

<p>Procedure:</p>

<p>1)  Place one half cup or 120 ml or cc  of nitric  acid in a large canning jar
    and bring the temperature to between 20  and  30 degrees Celsius (68-86 F)
    by putting the jar in a basin of cold water.</p>

<p>2)  Keep  the  thermometer  in  the  jar  so  you  can  closely  maintain  the
    temperature between your basins of hot and cold water.</p>

<p>3)  Weigh out 70 grams by weight or 18 teaspoons by  volume of  hexamin.  Then
    start adding the hexamin slowly at 1/2 teaspoon at a time over a 15 minute
    time period.  All the while maintaining the temperature between  20 and 30
    degrees celcius by moving it in and out of the cold water basins.</p>

<p>4)  When all the hexamin is dissolved in the acid  heat  the  solution  to  55
    degrees Celsius (131 F) by placing the jar  in a basin of hot water.  Then
    maintain this temperature for about ten minutes.
                                                                      Page 21</p>

<p>5)  Now remove the jar from the basin of hot water  and  place it in the basin
    of cold water and cool the jar to 20 degrees Celsius (68 F).  Now when the
    solution reaches 20 degrees Celsius add 3 cups (750ml) of  cold  water and
    white salt will appear.</p>

<p>6)  Now the white salt is RDX and should be handled with care.  Now filter the
    Acid/Water/RDX  solution  through  a  paper  towel  covering  the mouth of
    another jar.</p>

<p>7)  Wash the RDX crystals off the paper towel and add an additional  3 cups of
    fresh cold water &amp; a  teaspoon of sodium carbonate to neutralize the acid.
    Now stir rapidly for 3 minutes and then filter it out again.</p>

<p>8)  It is now usable, but I prefer purifying it by filling a quart canning jar
    2/3 full of acetone &amp; heating  the acetone then adding the RDX crystals to
    it a half teaspoon at a time until it completely dissolves in the acetone.</p>

<p>9)  Now that it is all dissolved let the solution cool to room temperature and
    let it stand for one hour.  The RDX will then precipitate again into  it's
    salt.  Then you must filter it through a paper towel around another  jar &amp;
    rinse it with cold water the same way you did before.   Now you  have  the
    finished product roughly 1 and 1/2 ounces of RDX.</p>

<p>10) Now store your finished product (after it dries) in ajar with an air tight
    lid for future use.  Seeing that RDX does not lose it's effectiveness  for
    months.</p>

<p>Uses:</p>

<p>RDX is a very powerful explosive however it can be compressed into tubes to
make detonators. Later in this newsletter I will prescribe a method for making
detonators in  which RDX  will  be  used  along  with  other explosives before
mentioned.  RDX  however is sensitive  to  friction,  and  can  be  used as an
explosive by itself.  It is also commonly referred to as Clyclonite.</p>

   This is basically a tutorial in making detonators, and there are a few
</code></pre>

<p>rules, that I would like each &amp; every one of you to follow. Making detonators
is very dangerous considering  that the  purpose of detonators is for them to
be sensitive and easily detonated, so be careful.  Also  the  detonators I am
telling you how to make are small, but the same principle can be applied on a
larger scale.</p>

<pre><code>                                                                  Page 22

<p>Materials:</p>

<h2>Name                                                      Source</h2>

<p>Empty .22 Magnum  shells  or  copper/brass/aluminum      Gun stores or hard-
tubing 1/4 inch in diameter and 1 inch long.  These      ware stores
tubes must also be closed at one end.</p>

<p>A substantial quantity of Secondary Explosive i.e. RDX   PETN is the center
(amount depends on how many detonators you  intend  to   filling of detonating
made) PETN can be substituted here.                      cords.</p>

<p>A substantial quantity of primary explosive i.e.
Mercury Fulminate or Acetone Peroxide.</p>

<p>An ignition charge of black powder.                      Gun stores FFF black
                                                         powder.</p>

<p>A  loading  press  (commonly used for reloading shells   Gun stores
also  please  be  safe  considering  a  few  of  these
detonators may  detonate  when  being  compressed,  so
take the neccessary precautions such as safety glasses
etc...)</p>

<p>Procedure:</p>

<p>NOTE: dirt  or  oil may sensitive  the  detonators to an unsafe level so when
handling the primary &amp; secondary &amp; ingnition charges  use tongs.  Also boil a
bucket of water in the room as humidity helps or if your in a house turn your
shower on hot and leave it on!</p>

<p>1)    Now light a candle, and  let  two  drops  of  wax  drip into each shell
      casing before use.  Then let the wax cool down.</p>

<p>2)    Now fill the casing to  a  depth of 1/4 inch with RDX or PETN, and then
      GENTLY  and  SLOWLY insert the ram  and  compress  the explosive slowly
      and evenly.  Now remove the ram slowly and carefully.</p>

<p>3)    Continue this process adding small amounts  of  RDX  or  PETN  until  a
      column of secondary explosive 5/8 of an inch high has been pressed into
      the 1 inch shell casing.</p>

<p>4)    Now add a small amount of Primary explosive the  same way you added the
      secondary explosive on top of the  secondary  explosive.  Now  add  the
      Mercury Fulminate or Acetone Peroxide on top of the 5/8  inch column of
      secondary explosive and compress it  with  the  ram  until it reaches a
      height of primary explosive 1/4 inch high.</p>

<p>5)    Now compress the remaining 1/8 of an inch with black powder.  Now  seal
      the top with wax paper or tape until ready for use.</p>

      resemble granulated sugar.
                                                                      Page 24</p>

<p>2)    Now measure out 2 parts by volume of sugar into the container, and then
      add 3 parts by volume of the Potassium Chlorate  to the container.  Now
      recap the container and shake the mixture for 4-5  minutes until it has
      a uniform color and consistency.</p>

<p>3)    Store  for  future use in an air tight container, but remember to shake
      it up before use to re-mix any settled particles.</p>

<p>Uses:</p>

<pre><code>  Now for a delayed reaction place the acid in a gelatin capsule  and bury
</code></pre>

<p>the gelatin capsule in the  Potassium Chlorate mixture.  Depending on how many
gelatin capsules you use &amp; their  size depends on the delay. It can range from
20 minutes to and hour or more.  This type of ignitor reaches a temperature of
3,200 degrees Fahrenheit and  can  ignite  most incendiaries.  It can also  be
compacted into a pipe to create a low power pipe bomb.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<pre><code>The trouble with chemical books these  days, is that they never explain
</code></pre>

<p>in detail how to make something that you want.  Sure, they tell you how the
Chinese did it in 1500 or ten  centuries  ago.  But now days, that does not
help.  Even some of the army manuals don't even give you enough information
on HOW-TO-DO it.</p>

<pre><code>It's a fun game to search out the materials that can be put together to
</code></pre>

<p>make something go "BOOM".  An interesting point to remember that it is much
easier to make a big explosion  than a small one.  It is very difficult for
a home expermienter to make  a  fire-cracker, but a bomb capable of blowing
the walls out of a building is easy.  You can find what you need in grocery
stores, hardware stores, and  farm  supplies.   Another,  but harder place,
to get chemicals is a chemical supply house.  These places can be dangerous
to your explosive career because some supply houses  were  told  to  report
people who buy chemicals in a certain combination. For example; If a person
were to buy tolulene, nitric acid, and sulfuric acid would be reported. The
reason:  those  chemicals  are  the  ones used in making Tri-nitro-tolulene
(TNT).</p>

<h2>WARNING:</h2>

<pre><code>The actual construction of the devices and materials described in  this
</code></pre>

<p>text are dangerous, even for an experienced  chemist.  Also, the  construc-
tion or possession of  many of these devices would be in violation of  many
federal, state, and local laws.</p>

<p>The author or authors are not responsible for what damages or trouble  that
the missuse of the information  that  is stated herein.  Therefore you  are
responsible for all of your actions that you make. Intended for information
purposes only.</p>

<pre><code>So, As you can tell this text  is  not  meant  to  be read by the total
</code></pre>

<p>IDIOT!  Before you attempt at making any of the  devices  I  would  suggest
that you have some knowledge about chemistry.  Remember:  SAFTEY FIRST!!!</p>

<pre><code>                                                                 Page 2

<h2>CHAPTER ONE      [LOW EXPLOSIVES]</h2>

<p>Low explosive are good for making a loud bang,  or  to  scare the living
daylight out of some poor person or even for making booby  traps.  In this
chapter  I  will  explain  the  making  of  many different  types  of  low
explosives.</p>

<h2>BLACKPOWDER</h2>

<pre><code>You will  need  potassium  or  sodium  nitrate,  sulfur,  and  hardwood
</code></pre>

<p>charcoal.  The common name for  potassium  nitrate  is  saltpeter.  Sodium
 nitrate is sold at farm supplies under the name of nitrate of soda.  It is
 also called chile saltpeter.  Sodium nitrate make a slightly more powerful
 black powder but has a disadvantage because  it  will absorb moisture from
 the air.  So, if you use it then be sure to store  it  in a dry, air tight
 container.  You also can get sulfur at farm supplies as a  wetable  powder
 used  for spraying.  It is cheap and works well.  Some  drug  stores  sell
 sulfur under  the  name of flowers of sulfur.  If you use nitrate of soda,
 it will be in the form of  little  round beads.  Bake it in an over at 200
 degrees for 10-15 minutes to drive out the moisture.  Then  dump  a cup or
 two into a blender and switch it  on.  It  will  do  a  beautiful  job  of
 reducing it to powder.  Buy  a  bag  of  charcoal  briquettes at a grocery
 store.  Put a few briquettes in a rag and pound with  a  hammer.  Dip  the
 results into the blender, grind, and strain through  a  tea strainer.  Mix
 by volume:</p>

<pre><code>6 parts potassium or sodium nitrate
2 parts powdered charcoal
1 part sulfur
</code></pre>

<p>This mixture will burn if ignited and will explode if ignited while tightly
confined.  It can  be  greatly  improved,  however,  by  processing  it  as
follows:</p>

<pre><code>Moisten with water until it will stick together when pinched between
thumb and finger.

Press it into a disposable aluminum pie pan.

Bake it in a preheated oven at 200 degrees for about 30 minutes.

Get it totally dry.  Grind into a fine a powder as possible with a
mortar and pestle.

If you use a blender at this  point, there is a danger of explosion.
It is not very sensitive to friction or impact, but is very sensitive
to sparks.

If you followed these directtions, you should have a fine slate-grey
powder.




                                                                 Page 3
</code></pre>

<h2>OTHER TYPES OF BLACKPOWDER</h2>

<pre><code>Below are eleven black/gun  powder  formulas.  They are more powerful
</code></pre>

<p>than the ordinary potassium nitrate  powder.  The  only  disadvantage (or
advantage) is that it is very  sensitive  to  sparks  and  some  leave  a
corrosive residue.  A word of caution: when  you  decide  to  make  these
compounds be careful for some of them might  decide to go up just because
they want to.</p>

<pre><code>[All chemicals are measured by volume]
</code></pre>

<p>1:  Potassium perchlorate  69.2%

     Potassium nitrate      40.0%
     Charcoal               11.0%</p>

<pre><code> The above chemical ratios are percentages.  When making the stuff, be
</code></pre>

<p>sure to grind up all the  ingredients  as  fine  as you possibly can.  The
finer you have the chemicals the better it will explode.</p>

<h2>ZINC EXPLOSIVE</h2>

<p>To make a big flash of flames almost instantly try mixing:</p>

<pre><code>     1 part Zinc dust
     1 part Sulfur
</code></pre>

<p>When these two mix together they  will  burst  into flame almost instantly!
Be careful for it does go off in a sudden flash and can singe anything that
it is around if not expecting it.  This is not a  powerful explosive but it
is violent even when not confined, so be careful.</p>

<h2>WATER FIRE STARTER</h2>

<p>So,  do you think water puts out  fires?  In  this  one,  it  starts  it.
Mixture:  ammonium nitrate + ammonium chloride + iodine + zinc dust. When a
drop or two of water is added, the ammonium nitrate forms nitric acid which
reacts with the zinc to produce hydrogen and heat.  The  heat vaporizes the
iodine (giving off purple smoke) and  the ammonium chloride (becomes purple
when mixed with  iodine  vapor).  It  will  ignite  the  hydrogen and begin
burning.</p>

<pre><code> Ammonium nitrate: 8 grams
 Ammonium choride: 1 gram
 Zinc dust       : 8 grams
 Iodine crystals : 1 gram
</code></pre>

<p>Following is a list of chemicals, most of which can be easily obtained.
You will also  find the chemical symbol of another chemical which explodes
on contact with said chemical. This is useful in making the ever so useful
pipe bomb.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWO         [HIGH EXPLOSIVES]</h2>

<pre><code>Now, here I stress the  word  of saftey.  These explosive compounds can
</code></pre>

<p>remove a limb or kill you.  So I would suggest, before you even think about
trying any of these, that you  have  some background knowledge on explosive
or  chemistry.  These  explosives  range  from  sound  sensitive  to  water
sensitive or electrically ignited.</p>

<pre><code>It takes time and patience to make high explosive compounds.  Some  are
</code></pre>

<p>easier than the others and some of the chemicals seem almost impossible  to
find.  In this part, to obtain most of the chemicals needed  her e you will
have  to  go though a chemical supply house.  Remember  that  some  of  the
chemical  houses  have  been  told  to  notify  the  police  if  a  certain
combination  of  chemicals  are  ordered  then  send  the  name and all the
information about that person ordering to the police.  And  it is  possible
that you might get a little visit from the city law.  Also,  making, using,
selling, or possession of many of the explosives  are  illegal  and  a hard
penalty can rise.  Even for first offenders.  Take this warning.  Its true!</p>

<h2>ASTROLITE</h2>

<pre><code> The astrolite family of liquid explosives  were  products  of rocket
</code></pre>

<p>propellant research in the '60's. Astrolite A-1-5 is supposed to  be  the
world's most powerful non-nuclear explosive -at about 1.8 to 2 times more
powerful than TNT.  Being more powerful it is also safer to  handle  than
TNT (not that it isn't safe in the first place) and Nitroglycerin.</p>

<pre><code> "Astrolite G  is  a  clear  liquid  explosive especially designed to
</code></pre>

<p>produce very high detonation  velocity,  8,600MPS (meters/sec.)  compared
with 7,700MPS for nitroglycerin and 6,900MPS for TNT. In addition, a very
unusual characteristic is that it the liquid explosive has the ability to
be absorbed easily into  the  ground while remaining detonable...In field
tests, Astrolite G has remained  detonable for 4 days in the ground, even
when the soil was soaked  due  to  rainy weather know what that means?...
Astrolite Dynamite!</p>

<pre><code> To make (mix in fairly large container &amp; outside) two parts by weight
</code></pre>

<p>of ammonium nitrate mixed with one part by  weight  'anhydrous' hydrazine,
produces Astrolite G... Feel free to use different ratios.</p>

<pre><code> Hydrazine is the chemical  you'll  probably  have  the  hardest  time
</code></pre>

<p>getting hold  of.  Uses  for  Hydrazine  are:  Rocket  fuel,  agricultural
chemicals  (maleic hydrazide), drugs (antibacterial and antihypertension),
polymerization catalyst, plating metals  on  glass  and  plastics,  solder
fluxes, photographic developers, diving  equipment.  Hydrazine is also the
chemical you should be careful with.</p>

<pre><code>                                                                 Page 7
</code></pre>

<h2>ASTROLITE A/A-1-5</h2>

<p>Ok, here's the good part...</p>

<p>Mix 20%(weight) aluminum powder to  the  ammonium nitrate,and then mix with
hydrazine.  The aluminum powder should be  100  mesh or finer.  Astrolite A
has a detonation velocity of 7,800MPS.</p>

<p>You should be careful not to get any of the astrolite on you, if it happens
though, you should flush the area with water.  Astrolite A&amp;G both should be
able to be detonated by a #8 blasting cap.</p>

<h2>SODIUM CHLORATE EXPLOSIVES</h2>

<p>Potassium chlorate is similar to Sodium chlorate,and in most cases can be a
substitute.  Sodium  chlorate  is  also more soluble in water. You can find
sodium chlorate at Channel or any  hardware/home  improvement store.  It is
used in blowtorches and you can get about 3lbs for about $6.00.</p>

<h2>SODIUM CHLORATE GUNPOWDER</h2>

<p>65% sodium chlorate
22% charcoal
13% sulphur</p>

<p>and sprinkle some graphite on top.</p>

<h2>ROCKET FUEL</h2>

<p>6 parts sodium chlorate mixed <em>THOROUGHLY</em> with 5 parts rubber cement.</p>

<h2>ROCKET FUEL 2 (better performance)</h2>

<p>50% sodium chlorate
35% rubber cement
10% epoxy resin hardener
 5% sulphur</p>

<p>You may wish to add more sodium chlorate depending on the purity you are
using.</p>

<h2>INCENDIARY MIXTURE</h2>

<p>55% aluminum powder (atomized)
45% sodium chlorate
5%  sulphur</p>

<pre><code>                                                                 Page 8
</code></pre>

<h2>IMPACT MIXTURE</h2>

<p>50% red phosphorus
50% sodium chlorate</p>

<p>Unlike potassium chlorate, sodium chlorate won't explode spontaneously when
mixed with phosphorus.  It has to be hit to be detonated.</p>

<h2>FILLER EXPLOSIVE</h2>

<p>85% sodium chlorate
10% vaseline
 5% aluminum powder</p>

<h2>NITROMETHANE EXPLOSIVES</h2>

<p>Nitromethane (CH3NO2)
Specific gravity: 1.139
Flash point     : 95f
Auto-ignite     : 785f</p>

<p>Derivation: Reaction of methane or propane with nitric acid under pressure.</p>

<pre><code>  Uses: Rocket fuel; solvent for cellulosic compounds, polymers, waxes,
        fats, etc.
</code></pre>

<p>To be detonated with a #8 cap, add:</p>

<p>1) 95% nitromethane + 5% ethylenediamine
2) 94% nitromethane + 6% aniline</p>

<p>Power output: 22-24% more powerful than TNT. detonation velocity of
              6,200MPS.</p>

<h2>NITROMETHANE 'SOLID' EXPLOSIVES</h2>

<p>2 parts nitromethane
5 parts ammonium nitrate (solid powder)</p>

<p>Soak for 3-5 min. when done, store in an air-tight container. This is
supposed to  be  30%  more  powerful  than  dynamite  containing  60%
nitroglycerin, and has 30% more brisance.</p>

<h2>PICRIC ACID</h2>

<pre><code>Phenol  is  melted  and  then  mixed  with  a  concentrated solution of
</code></pre>

<p>sulfuric  acid.  The mixture is  constatnly stirred and  kept  at  a steady
temperature of 95 degrees Celsius for  four to six hours  depending  on the
quantities of phenol used.  After this, the acid-phenol solution is diluted
                                                                     Page 9</p>

<p>with distilled water, and an  equal  excess amount of nitric acid is added.
The mixture of the nitric acid will cause an immediate reaction, which will
produce heat, so the addition of the acid must be performed slowly but more
importantly the temperature of the solution  must  not go above 110 degrees
Celsius.  Ten or so minutes after  the  addition  of nitric acid the picric
acid will be fully formed and you can drain off the excess acid.  It should
be filtered and  washed in the same manner as above until little or no acid
is present. When washing, use only cold water.  After this, the pircic acid
should  be  allowed  to  partially  dry.  Picric  acid  is  a more powerful
explosive than TNT, but it has its disadvantages.  It  is more expensive to
make, and it best handled in a wet 10  percent  distilled  water  form   as
pictic becomes very unstable when  completely  dry.  This  compound  should
never be put into  direct  contact  with  metal, since instantly on contact
there is a formation  of  metal  picrate, which explodes spontaneously upon
formation.</p>

<h2>TETRYL</h2>

<pre><code>A small amount of dimethyllaniline  is  dissolved  in  an excess amount
</code></pre>

<p>of concentrated sulfuric acid.  This mixture  is  now  added  to  an  equal
amount of nitric acid.  The new mixture is kept in an ice bath, and is well
stirred. After about five minutes,  the tetrylis filtered and  then  washed
in cold water.  It is now boiled in  fresh  water,  which  contains a small
amount  of   sodium  bicarbonate.  This  process  acts  to  neutralize  any
remaining acid.  The  washings  are  repeated  as  many  times as necessary
according to the litmus paper tests. When you are satisfied that the tetryl
is free of acids, filter it from the water and allowed to dry.  When tetryl
is detonated, it reacts in very much the same way as TNT.</p>

<h2>PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE FROM BLEACH</h2>

<pre><code> This explosive is a Potassium chlorate explosive.  This explosive  and
</code></pre>

<p>explosives of similar composition  were  used in WWI as the main  explosive
filler in grenades, land mines, and morter  rounds used by French,  German,
and some other forces involved in that conflict.</p>

<pre><code> These explosives are relatively  safe to manufacture.  The  procedures
</code></pre>

<p>in the following paragraph can be dangerous if you don't take special care.</p>

<pre><code> One should strive to make sure these explosives are free from  sulfur,
</code></pre>

<p>sulfides,  and  picric  acid.  The  presence  of  these compounds result in
mixtures that  are or can become highly sensitive  and  possibly  decompose
explosively while in storage.  One should never store home made explosives,
make enough for what you need at the time.  YOU NEVER KNOW HOW STABLE IT IS
UNTIL IT BLOWS!</p>

<pre><code> The  manufacter  of  this  explosive  from  bleach is given just as an
</code></pre>

<p>expediant method.  This method of manufacturing  potassium  chlorate is not
economical due to the amount of energy used to boil the solution  and cause
the "Dissociation" reaction to take place.  The  procedure  does  work  and
yields a relatively pure and a sulfur, sulfide free product.</p>

<pre><code> These explosives are  very cap sensitive and require only a #3 cap for
</code></pre>

<p>instigating detonation.
                                                                    Page 10</p>

<pre><code> To   manufacture   potassium   chlorate  from  bleach,  (5.25%  sodium
</code></pre>

<p>hypochlorite solution), obtain a heat  source,  hot-plate,  stove , etc., a
battery hydrometer, a  large  pyrex  or  enameled steel container, a triple
beam balance (to weigh chemicals),  and  some  potassium chloride, (sold as
salt substitute).</p>

<pre><code> Take  one  gallon  of  bleach  and place it in the container and begin
</code></pre>

<p>heating it.  While  this solution  heats,  weigh  out  63  grams  potassium
chloride and add this to the bleach being heated.  Bring this solution to a
boil and boil until when checked  with a hydrometer the reading is 1.3, (if
battery hydrometer is used, it should read FULL charge).</p>

<pre><code> When the  reading  is  1.3  take  the  solution and let it cool in the
</code></pre>

<p>refrigerator until it is between room temperature  and  0  degrees Celsius.
Filter out the crystals that have formed and save them.  Boil this solution
again and cool as before.  Filter and save the crystals.</p>

<pre><code> Take these crystals that  have  been saved and mix them with distilled
</code></pre>

<p>water in the  following proportions:  56 grams per 100 mililiters distilled
water. Heat that  solution until it boils  and  allow  to cool.  Filter the
solution and save the crystals  the  form  upon  cooling.  This p rocess of
purification is called fractional crystalization.  These crystals should be
relatively pure potassium chlorate.</p>

<pre><code> Powder these to the consistancy of face  powder  and  heat  gently  to
</code></pre>

<p>drive off all moisture.</p>

<pre><code> Melt five parts vaseline and five parts  wax.  Dissolve  this in white
</code></pre>

<p>gasoline, (camp stove gasoline), and pour this liquid on 90 parts potassium
chlorate, (the powdered crystals from above), in a plastic bowl.</p>

<pre><code> Knead this  liquid into the potassium chlorate until intimately mixed.
</code></pre>

<p>Allow all the gasoline to evaporate.</p>

<pre><code> Place this  explosive  in  a  cool dry place.  Avoid friction, sulfur,
</code></pre>

<p>sulfides, and phophorous compounds.  This  explosive  is best molded to the
desired shape and density of 1.3 grams in a cube and  dipped  in  wax  till
water proof.  These block type  charges  guarantee  the  highest detonation
velocity.</p>

<h2>RDX</h2>

<p>THE  PRODUCTION OF  RDX IS VERY DANGEROUS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE
DOING. DO NOT ATTEMPT ANY OF THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE TAKEN SAFTEY PRECAUTIONS.</p>

<p>Since the first part  of  WWII the armed forces of the United States has
been  searching  for  the  perfect  plastique  explosives  to  be  used  in
demolition work. This search lead to the development of the 'C' composition
plastique explosives.  Of  this group  C-4  being  the  lastest formulation
that has been readily adopted by the armed  forces.  This  formulation  was
preceded by C-3, C-2, and C.  In  this  series  of  articles,  I will cover
all  these  explosives  in their chronological  progression  as  they  were
developed and standardized  by  the armed forces.  All these explosives are
cyclonite (R.D.X.) base with  various  plastisizing  agents used to achieve
the desired product.  This plastisizer,  usually  composes  7%-20%  of  the
total weight of the plastique. Cyclotrimethylenetrinittrime or cyclonite is
                                                                    Page 11</p>

<p>manufactured   in   bulk   by   the  nitration  of  hexamethylenetetramine,
(methenamine, hexamine, etc., etc.)  with strong red 100% nitric acid.  The
hardest part of this reaction is obtaining this red nitric  acid.  It  will
most likely have to be made.  More  on this later.  Hexamine or methenamine
can usually be bought in bulk quantities or hexamine  fuel  bars  fo r camp
stoves can be used but they end up being very expensive.  To use  the  fuel
bars the need to be powered before hand.  The  hexamine  can  also  be made
with common ammonia water (30%) and the commonly avaliable 36% formaldehyde
solution.  To  make  this  componant place 185 grams of clear ammonia water
in a shallow pyrex dish.  To this add 500 ml. of the  formaldehyde solution
to the ammonia water.  Allow this to evaporate and  when  the  crystals are
all that remains in the pan place the pan in the  oven  on  the lowest heat
that the oven has. This should be done only for a moment or so to drive off
any remaining water. These crystals are scraped up and placed in a airtight
jar  to  store  them  until they are used.  To make the red nitric acid you
will need to buy a retort with a ground glass stopper.  In the retort place
32 grams sulfuric acid, (98%-100%), and  to  this add 68 grams of potassium
nitrate or 58  grams of sodium nitrate. Gently  heating  this  retort  will
generate a red gas called nitrogen trioxide.  THIS  GAS IS HIGHLY POISONOUS
AND THIS  STEP,  AS  WITH  ALL  OTHER  STEPS,  SHOULD  BE  DONE  WITH  GOOD
VENTILATION.  This  nitric  acid that is formed will collect in the neck of
the retort and form droplets that will  run  down the inside of the neck of
the retort and should be caught in a beaker  cooled  by being surrounded by
ice water.</p>

<p>This should  be  heated  till no more collects in the neck of the retort
and the nitric acid quits dripping  out  of the neck into the beaker.  This
acid  should  be  stored  until enough acid is  generated  to  produce  the
required size batch  which  is  determined  by  the  person  producing  the
explosive.  Of course  the  batch  can  be  larger  or smaller but the same
rations should be maintained.  To make R.D.X. place 550 grams of the nitric
acid produced by the above procedure in a 1000 ml. beaker in a salted bath.
50 grams of hexamine, (methenamine) is added  in small portions making sure
that the temperature of the acid DOES  NOT  GO  ABOVE  30  DEGREES CELCIUS.
This temperature can be monitored by  placing a thermometer directly in the
acid   mixture.  During  this  procedure  a  vigorous  stirring  should  be
maintained.  If the  temperature approaches 30 degrees, IMMEDIATLY STOP THE
ADDITION OF THE HEXAMINE until  the  temperature  drops  to  an  acceptable
level.  After the addition is complete continue the stirring  and allow the
temperature to drop to 0 degrees celcius and allow it to stay  there for 20
minutes coninuing the vigorous stirring.  After the 20 minutes are up, pour
this acid-hexamine mixture into  1000 ml.  of finely crushed ice and water.
Crystals should form and are filtered out of the liquid.  The crystals that
are filtered out are R.D.X.  and  will  need to have all traces of the acid
removed. To remove this trace of acid, first wash these crystals by putting
them in ice water and shaking and  refiltering.  These  crystals  are  then
placed in a little boiling water and filtered.  Place  them  in  some  warm
water and check the acidity for the resultant suspension with litmus paper.
You  want  it  to  read  between  6  and  7  on  the  Ph  scale.  If  there
is still  acid  in these crystals reboil them in fresh water until the acid
is removed and  the litmus paper shows them between 6 and 7, (the closer to
7 the better).  To  be safe these crystals should be stored water wet until
ready for use.  THESE CRYSTALS ARE A VERY  HIGH  EXPLOSIVE  AND  SHOULD  BE
TREATED WITH THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE! This explosive is much more powerful
than T.N.T.  To use, these will need to  be  dryed  for  some  manufaturing
processes in the next few articles.  To dry these crystals, place them in a
pan and spread them out and allow the water to evaporate off them until the
are  completely dry.  This explosive will detonate in this  dry  form  when
                                                                    Page 12</p>

<p>pressed into a mold to a density of 1.55 grams cubed, at a velocity of 8550
M/second!</p>

<h2>COMPOSITION 'C'</h2>

<p>All of the  type  'C'  plastic explosives (that includes C-2, C-3, and
C-4) are exceedingly powerful and should be used with utmost care.</p>

<p>This explosive is  just  a copy of a British  explosive that was adopted
early in WWII.  This  explosive  is the choice  explosive  of  the type 'C'
compounds  because  of its  relative  ease  of  manufacture  and  the  easy
aquisition of  the plastizer compound.  This  explosive  was  available  in
standard demolition blocks.</p>

<p>This   explosive  was  standardized   and  adopted  in   the   following
composition:</p>

<p>R.D.X.......................... 88.3%
Heavy mineral oil.............. 11.1%
Lecithin....................... 00.6%</p>

<p>(all percentages are by weight)</p>

<p>In this composition, the lecithin acts to prevent the formation of large
crystals of R.D.X.  which would  increase the sensitivity of the explosive.
This explosive has a  good  deal  of  power  and  is  relatively  non-toxic
(except when ingested).</p>

<p>It is also plastic  from  0-40  degrees  celcius.  Above  40 degrees the
explosive undergoes extrudation and becomes gummy  although  its  explosive
properties go relatively unimpaired.  Below  0  degrees  celcius it becomes
brittle and its cap sensitivity is lessened considerably.</p>

<p>Manufacturing this explosive  can  be  done  two  ways.  First  being to
dissolve the 11.7% plastisizing in unleaded gasoline and  mixing  with  the
R.D.X. and allowing the gasoline to evaporate until the  mixture is free of
all gasoline.</p>

<p>The second method being the simple kneading of the plastisizing compound
into the R.D.X.  until a uniform mixture is obtained.</p>

<p>This explosive should be stored in a cool-dry place.  If  properly  made
the plastique should be  very  stable in storage even if stored at elevated
temparatures for long periods of time.</p>

<p>It should be very cap sensitive.  A  booster  will  be  a  good  choice,
especially if used below 0 degrees celcius.  This  detonates  at a velocity
of 7900/MPS.</p>

<h2>COMPOSITION C-2 AND C-3</h2>

<p>These are highly undesirable because of certain  trait each has and they
don't produce as much power as 'C' and 'C-4' compounds.</p>

<pre><code>                                                                Page 13
</code></pre>

<p>It is not recommended you make  these  two types of plastique, this part
was written for imformatative  purposes  only.</p>

<p>Composition 'C-2' is harder to make  than  'C-4' and is TOXIC TO HANDLE.
It is also  unstable in storage  and  is  poor  choice  for  home explosive
manufacture. It also has a  lower  detonation velocity than either 'C-4' or
'C-3'.</p>

<p>It is manufactured in a steam jacketed (heated) melting kettle using the
same  procedure used in incorperation  of  'C-3'.  Its  composition  is  as
follows:</p>

<p>R.D.X................... 80%
Mononitrotolulene....... 5%
Dinitrotolulene......... 5%
T.N.T. guncotton........ 5%
Dimethylformide......... 5%</p>

<p>(see below for rest of recipe)</p>

<p>'C-3' was  developed  to  eliminate  the  undesirable  aspects of 'C-2'.
It was standardized and adopted by the military as  following  composition:</p>

<p>R.D.X................ 77%
Mononitrotolulene.... 16%
Dinitrotolulene...... 5%
Tetryl............... 1%
T.N.T. guncotton..... 1%</p>

<p>'C-3'  is  manufactured by mixing  the  plastisizing  agent  in  a steam
jacketed melting kettle equipped  with  a  mechanical  stirring attachment.
The kettle  is  heated  to  90-100  degrees  celcius  and  the  stirrer  is
activated.  Water wet R.D.X. is added to the  plastisizing  agent  and  the
stirring is continued until a uniform mixture is obtained and all water has
been driven off.  Remove the heat source but  continue  to stir the mixture
until it has cooled to room temperature.</p>

<pre><code>This explosive is as sensitive  to  impact  as is T.N.T.  Storage at 65
</code></pre>

<p>degrees celcius for four months at a relative  humidity  of  95%  does  not
impair it's explosive properties.</p>

<p>'C-3' is 133%  as  good as an explosive as T.N.T.  The major drawback of
'C-3' is its volatility which causes it to lose 1.2% of its weight although
the explosives detonation properties are not affected.</p>

<p>Water does not affect  explosives preformance.  Thus it is very good for
under-water demolition uses  and  would  be  a  good  choice  for  such  an
application.</p>

<p>When stored  at 77 degrees celcius considerable extrudation takes place.
It will become hard  at -29 degrees celcius and is hard to detonate at this
temperature.</p>

<p>While this explosive  is  not  unduely toxic,  it should be handled with
care as it contains aryl-nitro compounds  which  are  absorbed  through the
skin.</p>

<pre><code>                                                                Page 14
</code></pre>

<p>It will reliably take detonation from a #6 blasting cap but the use of a
booster is always  suggested.  This  explosive has a great blast effect and
was avaliable in standard demolition  blocks.  Its  detonation  velocity is
approximately 7700 MPS.</p>

<h2>GELATIN DYNAMITE</h2>

<p>Below are five different ways to make a very common explosive. Dynamite.</p>

<p>1)  Nitro........................ 12%
    Guncotten.................... .5%
    Amonium nitrate.............. 87.5%</p>

<p>2)  Nitro........................ 88%
    Potassium nitrate............ 5%
    Tetryl....................... 7%</p>

<p>3)  Nitro........................ 24%
    Guncotten.................... 1%
    Amonium nitrate.............. 75%</p>

<p>4)  Nitro........................ 75%
    Guncotten.................... 5%
    Potassium nitrate............ 15%
    Wood meal.................... 5%</p>

<p>5)  Nitro........................ 80%
    Ethalyne glycol dinitrate.... 20%</p>

<p>After making  this  stuff, pack it in a cardboard tube and expoxy each end.
But  be  careful  for  it  might  be  a  little  unstable  because  of  the
nitroglycerine (nitro).  Before  it is totally dry stick a good fuse in one
of the ends.  Light, Throw, and run as if your  life depended on it!  Which
in a way it does.</p>

<h2>PEROXYACETONE</h2>

<p>Peroxyacetone is VERY flamable &amp; has been reported to be shock sensitive.</p>

<p>Materials:</p>

<p>4ml of Acetone
  4ml of 30% Hydrogen Peroxide
  4 of drops conc. hydrochloric acid
  150mm test tube</p>

<pre><code>Add 4ml acetone and 4ml  hydrogen peroxide to the test tube. Then add 4
</code></pre>

<p>drops concentrated hydrochloric acid. In 10-20 minutes a white solid should
begin to appear. If no change is  observed,  warm  the test tube in a water
bath at 40 Celsius. Allow the reaction to continue for two hours. Swirl the
slurry and filter it.  Leave  out  on  filter paper to dry for at least two
hours.  To ignite, light a candle tied to a meter stick and light it (while
staying at LEAST a meter away).
                                                                    Page 15</p>

<h2>CELLULOSE NITRATE (GUNCOTTON)</h2>

<pre><code>Commonly known as Smokeless powder, Nitrocellulose is exactly that it
</code></pre>

<p>does not give off smoke when it burns.</p>

<p>Materials:</p>

<p>70ml of concentrated sulfuric acid
  30ml of concentrated nitric acid
  5g of absorbent cotton
  250ml of sodium bicarbonate
  250ml beaker
  ice bath
  tongs
  paper towels</p>

<p>Place 250ml beaker in the ice bath, add 70ml sulfuric acid, 30 ml nitric
acid. Divide cotton into .7g pieces. With tongs,  immerse each piece in the
acid solution for 1 minute. Next, rinse each piece in 3 successive baths of
500ml water.  Use fresh water for each piece.  Then immerse in 250ml sodium
bicarbonate. If  it bubbles, rinse in water once  more  until  no  bubbling
occurs.  Squeeze dry and spread on paper towels to dry overnight.</p>

<h2>NITROGEN TRIIODIDE</h2>

<pre><code>This is  very  shock sensitive  when it comes to being agitated, moved,
</code></pre>

<p>dropped, touched,  breathed  on... etc.  For  one thing I hope you don't do
any of those.  This has a high explosive value to it.  It can move a lot of
mass with just a little compound.  I  have  heard so many different ways to
make this, and this is the best one.  I think.</p>

<pre><code>Take a medium glass and fill it up  with  ammonium hydroxide (household
</code></pre>

<p>ammonia).  Take  some iodine crystals and pour  about a fourth of the glass
full.   Wait  about 30  minutes  to  an  hour  then  pour  off  the  liquid
remaining.  Now, what you have in the  glass it called nitrogen tri-iodide,
which is very sensitive to touch.  But, it  is  perfectly  save  when it is
wet.  Thats why  you  do  not  let  it  dry  until  you want to use it.  To
detonate it just pour some of the wet stuff on  an  object  and  wait  till
omething agitates it.  Remember too much can harm a lot of things.  It does
pack a wallop!</p>

<h2>NITROGLYCERIN</h2>

<pre><code>Nitroglycerin  is  a  very  high  explosive.  It is used all around the
</code></pre>

<p>world to do  many different types of  jobs.  To make nitro here is what you
have to do:</p>

<pre><code>By weight, one part of glycerin is nitrated with 6 parts of mixed acid.
</code></pre>

<p>The  mixed  acid  is composed of 40% nitric  and  60%  sulfuric  acid.  The
sulfuric acid  is  slowly added to the nitric acid  with constant stirring.
Never mix them the other way round for  they  will  splatter.  Each part of
glycerin  will  yield  2.3  parts  of  nitroglycerin.  The temperature when
adding  the  glycerin  to  the  acids should  never  go  above  25  degrees
                                                                    Page 16</p>

<p>centigrade.  If it does or if red  fumes  appear, the whole mess should  be
dumped into cold water fast.  Do not  take this as an encouragement to make
nitroglycerin.  It is a dangerous procedure to mix all these types of acids
together and can easily be lost control of.</p>

<h2>MAKING SULFURIC ACID</h2>

<pre><code>No, your not really MAKING sulfuric  acid,  you are just making it more
</code></pre>

<p>concentrated.  All you need to do is to take a old car battery and dump all
of the acid into a GLASS bowl that can be set on a stove.  Do not use metal
for unwanted occurances could come about.  Just  take the old acid and boil
it until you see white fumes come out.  When  you  do  immediately turn off
the heat and let it cool.  One thing,  DO NOT  use  a  gas  stove.  Use  an
electric hot plate &amp; make it outside because the fumes are very  poisonous.</p>

<h2>T.N.T    (Trinitrotoulene)</h2>

<pre><code>Mix 170 parts toulene with 100 parts acid.  The acid being composed of:
</code></pre>

<p>2 parts 70% nitric acid and  3  parts  100%  sulfuric  acid.  Mix  below 30
degrees.  Set this for 30 minutes and let  seperate.  Take  the  mononitro-
toluene and mix with 100 parts of  it  with  215  parts of acid.  This acid
being composed of:  1 part pure nitric acid and 2 parts pure sulfuric acid.
Keep the temperature at 60 -70 degrees while they are slowly  mixed.  Raise
temperature to 90 - 100 degrees and stir for 30 minutes.</p>

<pre><code>The  dinitrotoulene  is seperated and mixed with 100 parts of this with
</code></pre>

<p>225 parts of  20%  oleum,  which  is  100%  sulfuric  acid  with  20% extra
dissolved sulfur  trioxide,  and  64 parts nitric acid.  Heat at 95 degrees
for 60 minutes and then at 120 degrees for  90 minutes. Seperate the trini-
trotoluene and  slosh  it around in hotwater.  Purify the powder by soaking
it in benzene.</p>

<h2>MERCURY FUMLMINATE</h2>

<pre><code>Mix 2 parts of  Nitric  Acid with 2 part alcohol (any kind) and 1 part
</code></pre>

<p>mercury.  This is very shock sensitive explosive.  Be careful, Nitric Acid
is an unstable acid.  It will react to agitation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THREE       [INCENDIARIES]</h2>

<pre><code>What is an incendiary?  Those  are compounds that do not go "boom", but
</code></pre>

<p>can burn fast and generate  a  lot  of heat.  For example, thermite, its an
incendiary, because it can produce temperatures will up in the hundreds and
can even melt metal.</p>

<h2>NAPALM</h2>

<pre><code>This  is  just  gasoline  in a thickend form.  What it does is burn for
</code></pre>

<p>long periods of time.  If it is made right I hear that water can't even put
it out.  What you do is take some  polystyrine  (styrofoam) and place it in
some unleaded gasoline (unleaded works better).  Keep  feeding styrofoam to
the gas until you can not feed any more at all.  At  points  it  will  look
like thats all it can take, just wait for  a  minute and let  the other gas
rise to the top.  It will take a lot of stryrofoam  until  you get what you
want.  When it is done, it will burn for a long time.  I would suggest that
you do not place any on you because once it is  lit  it  will  travel quite
quickly since it melts the thickend gasoline  and  it  rolls down.  This is
also fun to play with.  The only  problem with it  is it gives off too much
smoke (which, I may add - is poison).</p>

<h2>THERMITE</h2>

<pre><code>This is the arsonists dream!  Thermite is a very hot mixture.  Although
</code></pre>

<p>it is slightly hard to get ignited, so it is safe to transport it.  Here is
what you do:  Thermite  is  made  from  powdered  aluminum  and  iron oxide
(rust).  Mix two parts by volume  powdered  alumnium  with three parts iron
oxide.  This stuff is hard to light,  but  once you get it going don't plan
on putting it out, because it can produce  enough  heat  to  melt through a
steel plate.  The finer the ingredients  are  the  easier  it  will  be to
ignite.</p>

<h2>CHEMICALLY IGNITED EXPLOSIVES</h2>

<pre><code>A mixture of 1 part potassium chlorate to 3 parts table sugar (sucrose)
</code></pre>

<p>burns  fiercely  and  brightly (similar to the burning of magnesium) when 1
drop of concentrated  sulfuric  acid is placed on it.  What occurs is this:
when  the acid is added it reacts  with  the  potassium  chlorate  to  form
chlorine dioxide, which explodes on formation, burning the sugar as well.</p>

<pre><code>                                                                Page 18

<h2>CHAPTER FOUR          [SMOKE BOMBS]</h2>

<pre><code>So, you want  a  smoke screen?  Well this chapter will explain how many
</code></pre>

<p>different types of smoke can be made.  Even colored smoke.</p>

<h2>SMOKE PRODUCER</h2>

<pre><code>The following reaction should produce a fair  amount of smoke.  Since
</code></pre>

<p>this reaction is not  all  that dangerous  you  can use larger amounts if
necessary for larger amounts of smoke.</p>

<p>6g zinc powder
   1g sulfur powder</p>

<pre><code>Insert a red hot wire into the pile, step back. A lot of smoke should
</code></pre>

<p>be created.</p>

<h2>SMOKE BOMB</h2>

<p>This is the father of all smoke bombs.  Mix:</p>

<pre><code>     2 part Potassium Nitrate
     1 Part Granulated sugar.

 Put this under a very low heat source and melt the sugar and potassium
</code></pre>

<p>nitrate.  After it is melted let it set and  get  hard.  When it gets hard,
just take outside and hold a lit match on  an  area   of the smoke bomb and
wait till it lights.  You will know when it  is about to ignite because the
stuff turns black and will then spit and sputter and smoke will pour out of
the compound.  You also can light it  without  melting  it but it burns too
fast and will make a hudge flame while the other one does not.</p>

<h2>HTH CHLORINE SMOKE BOMB</h2>

<pre><code>Take HTH pool chlorine and some non-silicon brake fluid and mix the two
</code></pre>

<p>together in a ratio of 4 parts  chlorine  to  1 part brake fluid.  When you
mix the two together they will begin to sizzle  and  then  it will begin to
smoke.  It will take about 30 seconds to start smoking fully.  When it does
begin to smoke it will produce  a  stinking cloud of thick white smoke.  If
you do not be careful it could burst into flames and burn what it is in.  I
suggest to place the mixture in a glass  container for  it  gets  real hot.
And anybody in their right mind will not go  pick it up and try to throw it
when it has done smoking.  The  smoke  is  known to last for over 2 minutes
and is also toxic because it produces chlorine gas, which is deadly!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FIVE             [BOMBS]</h2>

<p>This is the point I really stress the word  saftey!  At  this  point  it
should  be  well  excercised  and  you  had better know  what you are doing
before you even attempt to construct some of these  devices.  Remember that
the law prohibits the manufacture and use of such devices, and you could be
breaking the law in some places.  If you do  make on of the devices that is
listed in here then I would suggest you make  a  prototype and set that one
off in the country and if it worked correctly then make your final  one and
use it the way you had in mind.</p>

<h2>GENERIC BOMB</h2>

<pre><code>Aquire a glass container.  Put in a few drops of gasoline.  Cap the top
</code></pre>

<p>and turn the  container  around to coat the inner surface.  Add a few drops
of potassium permanganate  (found  in a snake-bite kit) .  To detonate just
throw against a hard object.  I  hear  this  is the same as a half stick of
dynamite!</p>

<h2>FIREBOMBS</h2>

<pre><code>Most firebombs are simply gasoline filled bottles with a oil soaked rag
</code></pre>

<p>in the mouth.  The original  firebomb  was  one  part gasoline and one part
motor oil.  The oil makes it splatter and  stick  on  what  your  trying to
burn.  Some use one part roofing  tar  or  one  part melting wax to 2 parts
gasoline.</p>

<h2>PIPE BOMB</h2>

<p>A pipe bomb is very easy to make.  But is also very dangerous!</p>

<p>To construct a pipe bomb you  will  need  a piece of pipe about one foot
long.  Some fine gun  powder,  a solar ignitor, and a battery.  Cap one end
of the pipe very good with a cap.  Pour some  gun  powder  in the other end
about little over the middle.  Cap  the  pipe  on  the other end and make a
small hole in the middle of the pipe.  Now wrap the whole  pipe in electric
tape and make the hole again. Place in the head of the solar ignitor in the
hole.  Tape the ignitor down so it will not fall out.</p>

<p>To ignite the bomb I suggest you take a VERY long wire and connect it to
the electrodes of the solar ignitor and run it very far away.  Then connect
the  battery at the other end of the wire.  DO NOT touch the battery to the
electrodes of the bomb for even a  second, because it WILL explode!!!</p>

<p>Remember  take  a  long  two  conductor  wire  and  connect  it  to  the
electrodes and run it  far away and then connect the battery to it.  If you
made it correctly it will explode upon contact with the battery!  Remember,
this can kill you.  This also can do a lot of property damage.</p>

<pre><code>                                                                Page 23
</code></pre>

<h2>CONTACT GRENADE</h2>

<p>Materials:  2-3 in. section of pipe
                PVC (for test and fun)
                Steel (for shrapnel)</p>

<pre><code>        12 guage shotgun shell
            (fitted to pipe)

        marble
        ping pong ball
        cap for pipe

        2-3 ft. ribbon
            (flights)

        explosive charge
            (of personal preferance)
            a 1/2 or 1/4 cup petrol makes an excellent charge when
            vaporized filling the pipe with gunpowder is simplest
            or any STABLE flammable explosive one may have.


This design  is  a  modified  pipebomb  which will be set off upon hard
</code></pre>

<p>contact.  This  makes things much easier than tossing molotove cocktails or
lighting fuses as all you do is throw it and it should detonate on contact.</p>

<p>1)  Cut the plastic of the shotgun  shell off of the primer and set aside.</p>

<p>2)  Carefully fit the  primer into one end of the pipe and epoxy securely.</p>

<p>3)  Glue the marble to the 'dimple' of the primer.</p>

<p>4)  Cut the ping  pong  ball in half and then glue half onto the marble to
     make a simple form of casing.</p>

<p>5)  Put explosive charge into the hollow pipe (if useing gasoline use only
     1/4 of the  volume  of  pipe.  Reason: 1 gal. of gas vapor = 16 sticks
     dynamite!!!).</p>

<p>6)  Cap the pipe and epoxy into place.</p>

<p>7)  Tie ribbon around tail section of pipe.</p>

<pre><code>Relax.  Now that its finished  heres  how  it  works.  When  thrown the
</code></pre>

<p>grenade will come down upon the point because of the tail flights.  When it
hits, the primer will be crushed by the marble, setting it off.  The primer
then ignites the explosive charge.  I  heartily  recommend that PVC be used
for testing as the steel pipe is  rather  dangerous.  This  design is not a
toy and should not be built to be played  with.  If  you  want  a  toy just
empty a shotgun shell and tape a marble to the primer  and throw.  It makes
a quasi-safe firework.</p>

<pre><code>                                                                Page 24
</code></pre>

<h2>CARBIDE BOMB</h2>

<pre><code>Obtain some calcium carbide.  This is the stuff that is used in carbide
</code></pre>

<p>lamps and can be found at nearly any hardware store.  Take a few pieces and
put it in a  glass jar with some water.  Put a lid on tightly.  The carbide
will react with the water  to  produce acetylene carbonate which is similar
to the gas used in curring torches.  Eventually the glass will explode from
internal pressure.  If you leave  a burning rag nearby, you will get a nice
fireball.</p>

<h2>HINDENBERG BOMB</h2>

<pre><code>Get, a balloon, bottle, Liquid Plummer,  foil,  and  a  length of fuse.
</code></pre>

<p>Fill the  bottle 3/4 full with the Liquid plummer and add a little piece of
alumninum  foil.  Put the balloon over the next of  the  bottle  until  the
balloon is full of the resulting gas.  This  is  highly flammable hydrogen.
Now tie the  balloon.  Tape the fuse to the outside of the inflated balloon
and light.  Let  the  balloon rise into the air.  When the fuse gets to the
balloon and bursts it, the hydrogen will cause a fireball.</p>
