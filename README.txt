Hey guys!

I'm more than happy to see that you have downloaded my program, ICE Compiler.
This program compilers a TI-BASIC-like language to ASM, the machine code.
In that way, the OS doesn't need to interpret TI-BASIC, compile it to ASM,
and run that ASM code, so this program can be MUCH faster than the original
TI-BASIC. Create awesome games, with an incredible speed, using the awesome
color screen. Of course, there are many limitations, because TI-BASIC itself
is pretty extensive. That is why I included a commands list. I highly 
recommend you to take a look at that list, to see what you can all include 
in your program. Also, although you can assume I've insane tested it, it can
happen that either ICE or you do something wrong, that causes a RAM reset.
That is why you should use if possible CEmu, an emulator for the TI-84+CE.
You can download it here: https://github.com/CE-Programming/CEmu 
If you are pretty sure you didn't anything wrong, and ICE is the problem, 
please post it in the ICE thread at Cemetech: http://cemete.ch/p247260
(that is the forum I look daily at). You can also reach me through one of
the 4 other calc forums: CodeWalrus, TI-Planet, Omnimaga and ticalc.
If you don't have an account, and neither want to make one, you can reach 
me via petertillema@solcon.nl (don't spam!).

I hope you like my program, and feel free to post any bugs, comments or
whatever you want to :)


Peter "PT_" Tillema
